📔 World 3 - The Story:

You wake up and have a bump on your head. You can not remember anything. You realize somebody has used your time-machine (which is possible because the user interface is so good). The world would be in danger and we would not exist if this person leaves anything behind! Changing something will break the time-line and this world explodes immediately! You have to chase the person with the time-machine.
